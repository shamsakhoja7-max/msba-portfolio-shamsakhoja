# My Individual Contribution

## Key Contributions:
I led large parts of the EDA and data pre-processing. I evaluated four modeling approaches: Lasso Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost. I also performed K-means segmentation and helped shape the business recommendations by highlighting behavioural insights and trade-offs between risk, value, and feasibility.

## Decisions I advocated:
Two key decisions:  
First, I advocated for selecting CatBoost over XGBoost. The rationale was to preserve categorical signals critical to understanding customer behavior, while also delivering the strongest PR-AUC performance among the models tested.  

Second, I pushed to classify Segment 2 as a split-wallet group with meaningful cross-sell potential rather than a low-value segment. This came from recognizing the combination of very low data usage and weak adoption of data and streaming add-ons as an opportunity, not a limitation.

## Lessons learned and improvements:
I developed a structured, step-by-step approach to solving analytics problems and learned to move beyond surface findings to uncover deeper drivers in the data. I also strengthened my ability to defend recommendations by tying them tightly to quantitative evidence and business economics.

With more time, I would further formalize an execution framework to operationalize the recommendations and design measurement models to quantify the true uplift from the proposed actions.
